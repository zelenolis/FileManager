    - Copy file:
    cp path_to_file path_to_new_directory

    - Move file:
    mv path_to_file path_to_new_directory

    - Delete file:
    rm path_to_file

3. Operating system info

    os --homedir

    - Get current system user name
    os --username

    - Get CPU architecture for which Node.js binary has compiled
    os --architecture

4. Hash

    - Calculate hash for file and print it into console
    hash path_to_file

5. Compress and decompress operations

    - Compress file. You can omit path_to_destination then the file will be placed in the current folder
    compress path_to_file 
    compress path_to_file path_to_destination
